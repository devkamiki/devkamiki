## 您好！Hello! Hallo! こんにちは！ Guten Tag! Bonjour!

I'm Kamiki Yuki, 神木 友希 as written in Kanji. Proudly inherited my surname from [this guy](https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Akinari_Kamiki) and described myself as the pink alligator in the story. :3 
- Coming from China, I will be joining [Technische Universiteit Eindhoven](https://tue.nl) as a student in mechanical engineering, Werktuigbouwkunde as in Dutch.
- Assigned female at birth, I am identified as agender, asexual and aromantic, and open to all pronouns.
- My faith and aim is to lead a minimalist digital life, as well as contributing to open-source, community-driven projects as much as possible.
- I am unfortunately blunt in mathematics.
- I love queers and neurodiverse people.
- I love 19th century literature.
- It's not vanilla Arch, but I use EndeavourOS, btw!
